Do not commence working over your blog without the vision. "If you don't know where you are going, any road will get you there!" You want to avoid that mistake. Spend some time dreaming of the final form of your site.

Highly sought after content is important but not as much as your commitment to excel in its delivery. Write from your heart. Listen to your inner voice. Follow your own curiosity. Not the trends. Not what would be profitable. Forget about the noise in the blogosphere. If you want to shine as a diamond, you need to get cut as a diamond.

Your blog should be a reflection of your personality. Forget about achieving success quickly. It will take time. It will count in years. Just remember: "Success [in this venture] is something that you attract by becoming an attractive person".

Don't rush. Make a plan. Build your blog around the uniqueness of your writing. And don't worry about "instant" followers.

Lastly, write less frequently. However, deliver pearls. Not plums.

> 没有***愿景***就不要动手写博客。“没有方向，就是瞎莽！”要避免犯这样的错误。花点时间想一想你网站最终的样子。
>
> 追逐热点内容固然是重要的，但不及***高质量的提交***。听从自己的心声，遵循自己的兴趣，而不是流行时尚和利益。忘掉博客圈子里的喧嚣。要想成器，就要经得起雕琢。
>
> 你的博客要反应你的***个性***。忘记速成，成功需要时间，需要经年累月。记住：“成功就是被自己身上的吸引力给吸引到”。
>
> 不要急躁，要有***计划***。博客要围绕着自己的独特性。不要理会“催更”的读者们。
>
> 最后一点，别写太频繁，***宁缺毋滥***。
